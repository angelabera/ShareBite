**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
A clear description of what is missing. (e.g., "I can't see how far the food is from my current location").

**Describe the solution you'd like**
How should this work in ShareBite? (e.g., "Integrate the Geolocation API to sort listings by distance").

**Technical Impact**
Which files will this affect? (e.g., `script.js` for the API logic and `style.css` for the distance badge).

**Additional context**
Add any mockups or examples from other apps.
